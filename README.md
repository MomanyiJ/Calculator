CALCULATOR PROJECT
==================
- When user starts the program, only exit when the user presses 'q' then Enter.
- At startup, present a list of operations possible(div, mul, add, sub).
- Prompt the user to input their operations: >
- If they choose div, prompt for the first number >, and then the second number >, then 
perform division
- If they choose any other operation, keep taking numbers until they enter d, then perform the 
operation and render result.
